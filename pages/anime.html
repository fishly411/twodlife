		       <h5>Fullmetal Alchemist</h5>
        <p>Fullmetal Alchemist is an anime that left a lasting impression on me as a child. The story of two brothers on a search for the Philosopher's Stone really hooked me, and I later sought it out to finish watching the series. While it differs from the manga, I think the original anime had a stronger beginning than its counterpart, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, which follows the manga more closely. Both versions are worth watching and offer different perspectives on the story. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a thrilling adventure and a well-developed story</p>
