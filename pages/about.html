					<p>Two D Life is a tittle of the site. A play on words that represents the anime world, which is typically portrayed in 2D animation and centered around the lives of its characters.As an anime enthusiast, I watch at least an hour every day. To share my love for anime, I created this site with personal anime recommendations. The images are sourced from Wikipedia and belong to the anime. The homepage image is credited to Wallpapercave, and the About page image is from Animemotivation. I don't own any images, but I hope they help you discover a new favorite anime.</p>
